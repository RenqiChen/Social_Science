    Reviewer Guidelines:

    1. Summary: Briefly summarize the paper and its contributions. This is not the place to critique the paper; the authors should generally agree with a well-written summary.
    2. Strengths and Weaknesses: Please provide a thorough assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, touching on each of the following dimensions:
        - Originality: Are the tasks or methods new? Is the work a novel combination of well-known techniques? (This can be valuable!) 
        Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions?
        - Quality: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported 
        (e.g., by theoretical analysis or experimental results)? Are the methods used appropriate? 
        Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work.
        - Clarity: Is the submission clearly written? Is it well organized? 
        (If not, please make constructive suggestions for improving its clarity.) 
        Does it adequately inform the reader? (Note that a superbly written paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce its results.)
        - Significance: Are the results important? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? 
        Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work? Does it advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way? 
        Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?
    3. Questions: Please list up and carefully describe any questions and suggestions for the authors. 
    Think of the things where a response from the author can change your opinion, clarify a confusion or address a limitation. 
    This can be very important for a productive rebuttal and discussion phase with the authors.  
    4. Ethical concerns: If there are ethical issues with this paper, please flag the paper for an ethics review.
    5. Overall: Please provide an "overall score" for this submission. Choices:
        - 10: Award quality: Technically flawless paper with groundbreaking impact on one or more areas of AI, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility, and resources, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.
        - 9: Very Strong Accept: Technically flawless paper with groundbreaking impact on at least one area of AI and excellent impact on multiple areas of AI, with flawless evaluation, resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.
        - 8: Strong Accept: Technically strong paper with, with novel ideas, excellent impact on at least one area of AI or high-to-excellent impact on multiple areas of AI, with excellent evaluation, resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.
        - 7: Accept: Technically solid paper, with high impact on at least one sub-area of AI or moderate-to-high impact on more than one area of AI, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.
        - 6: Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact paper, with no major concerns with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility, ethical considerations.
        - 5: Borderline accept: Technically solid paper where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Please use sparingly.
        - 4: Borderline reject: Technically solid paper where reasons to reject, e.g., limited evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept, e.g., good evaluation. Please use sparingly.
        - 3: Reject: For instance, a paper with technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility and incompletely addressed ethical considerations.
        - 2: Strong Reject: For instance, a paper with major technical flaws, and/or poor evaluation, limited impact, poor reproducibility and mostly unaddressed ethical considerations.
        - 1: Very Strong Reject: For instance, a paper with trivial results or unaddressed ethical considerations

    ## Examples:
    
    "Summary": "The paper introduces an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models, aiming to balance global structure and local details in generated samples. The novel architecture incorporates two parallel branches and a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism to dynamically balance their contributions throughout the denoising process. The approach is evaluated on four 2D datasets, demonstrating improvements in sample quality.", 
    "Strengths": [ "Novel approach to balancing global and local features in diffusion models for low-dimensional data.", "Comprehensive empirical evaluation on multiple 2D datasets.", "Adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts focus during denoising." ], 
    "Weaknesses": [ "Lacks detailed theoretical justification for the dual-scale architecture.", "Computational cost is significantly higher, which may limit practical applicability.", "Some sections are not clearly explained, such as the autoencoder aggregator and weight evolution analysis.", "Limited diversity in the datasets used for evaluation. More complex, real-world datasets could strengthen claims.", "Insufficient ablation studies and analysis on specific design choices like different types of aggregators." ], 
    "Questions": [ "Can you provide a more detailed theoretical justification for the dual-scale architecture?", "What impact do different types of aggregators have on the model's performance?", "How does the model perform on more complex, real-world low-dimensional datasets?", "Can the computational cost be reduced without sacrificing performance?" ], 
    "Ethical Concerns": false, 
    "Overall": 5
